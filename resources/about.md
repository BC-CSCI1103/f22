## About

This course serves dual purposes both as the Honors introductory course for Computer Science and as a 2000-level elective in Functional Programming. The 2000-level version of the course is a good option for Bachelor of Arts in CS majors looking to fulfill the 2000-level elective requirement. Of course this is one course, but students enrolled in the 2000-level version  will have additional work requirements on several problem sets.

 CSCI 1103 teaches coding using the [OCaml](http://ocaml.org) dialect of the [ML functional programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)). By the end of the course you should be able to design fairly complex programs that do interesting and useful things. Although almost all of the work you do for the course involves coding, the subject is wider than just the writing of programs, much less programs in any particular programming language. You will learn something about the particular approach Computer Science takes to representing and manipulating information, and to solving problems.

### Methods

CSCI 1103 is an immersion course, we'll be learning about computation by immersing ourselves in OCaml code. The first order of business is to learn how to code. By way of demonstration, we'll be covering a lot 
of OCaml code in class.  Our starting point will be familiar to anyone experienced with basic high-school algebra. Using this as our foundation, we'll introduce new programming concepts and constructs, step by step, until we've covered most of the tools available to programmers developing small-scale programs (involving what are called *procedural abstractions*). Our first programs will have between say 10 and 20 lines of code. By the end of the semester we'll be able to manage programs with a few hundred lines of code.

Like playing a musical instrument, coding is a skill that can only be developed with practice. Learning to code is hard work but, as you'll find, getting a piece of software to work is extremely satisfying.

CSCI 1103 consists of three weekly 50 minute lectures and one weekly 50 minute lab. There will be weekly problem sets, all of which require the development of OCaml code. Some problem sets will involve hand-written work and diagrams.

### Learning On Line

**CSCI 1103 Computer Science 1 Honors, meets MWF 11AM [On Line](https://bccte.zoom.us/j/3306891980).**

Obviously we are in unusually difficult times so we'll all have to work a little harder to continue to grow and learn notwithstanding the challenges presented by the pandemic. In my experience, the most difficult challenge presented by on-line learning is engagement. So please make an extra effort to gear up for each meeting and engage with the class and lab sections. Ask questions and try to volunteer to offer answers. Consider keeping your camera on during zoom meetings. We want a high level of energy as we explore this incredible field.
