Robert Muller - Boston College

### Fall 2022

## Grading

Like most CS courses, CSCI 1103 is very much a *learn by doing* course. Reflecting this, grades will emphasize the problem sets. Grades will be computed on a 200 point scale. The points are distributed as follows:

+ 110 points over 7 open problem sets;

+ 60 points over 3 closed problem sets, these are effectively take-home exams;

+ 30 points for lab, class and piazza participation.

Grades will be recorded on the Canvas website.

#### Notes:

+ Problem sets must be submitted by pushing your problem set repository to GitHub by midnight on the due date. From a Unix shell, the process would look something like:

  ```bash
  > cd
  > cd csci1103/ps8-smith
  > git add .
  > git commit "Martha Smith: Final"
  > git push
  ```

  Unless specified otherwise, **problem sets will be due on Mondays at midnight**. 

+ Under no circumstances at all can code be submitted for grading by attaching it to an email message. An attempt to submit code via email probably won't receive a reply notifying the sender that the attempted submission failed. 


+ Late open problem sets will be penalized 25% each day.
+ Late closed problem sets will not be accepted without a written note from a physician.
+ Any violation of the [university's policy on academic integrity](http://www.bc.edu/offices/stserv/academic/integrity.html) will result in a failing grade for the course.
