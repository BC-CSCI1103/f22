- [OCaml from the Very Beginning](http://ocaml-book.com/), by John Whitington. (**Required**)

 ![Whitington](img/whitington.jpg)

This is a relatively easy introductory text.  A no-prerequisites approach to teaching a modern general-purpose programming language. Each small, self-contained chapter introduces a new topic in tutorial style, building until the reader can write quite substantial programs. There are plenty of questions and, crucially, worked answers and hints.

This book can be purchased at the BC Bookstore or from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/OCaml-Very-Beginning-John-Whitington/dp/0957671105%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dcoherentpdfco-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0957671105) for about $35.
