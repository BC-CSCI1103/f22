- [OCaml from the Very Beginning](http://ocaml-book.com/), by John Whitington. (**Required**)

 ![Whitington](img/whitington.jpg)

This is a relatively easy introductory text.  A no-prerequisites approach to teaching a modern general-purpose programming language. Each small, self-contained chapter introduces a new topic in tutorial style, building until the reader can write quite substantial programs. There are plenty of questions and, crucially, worked answers and hints.

**There is now a free [on-line edition](http://ocaml-book.com/) of this fine book.**

If you prefer a hardcopy, this book can be purchased at the BC Bookstore or from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/OCaml-Very-Beginning-John-Whitington/dp/0957671105%3FSubscriptionId%3D0ENGV10E9K9QDNSJ5C82%26tag%3Dcoherentpdfco-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0957671105) for about $35.
